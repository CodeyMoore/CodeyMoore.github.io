### A preference bundle with essential commands
Are you on iOS 11 or newer? check out [Essential Utilities (iOS 11-13)](https://codeymoore.github.io/repo/depiction/web/com.codeymoore.essentialutilities.html)  

Essentially this package is the same as Essential Utilities but specifically built for iOS 10 and below  

Tested iOS'  
6.1.6 and 9.3.5 \
It should work on iOS 7, 8 and 10 \
It should also work on iOS 5 but I'm unable to test  

A simple preference bundle thats gives users the able to -
- Enter Safe Mode
- Reset UICache
- Restart SpringBoard
- Restart BackBoardd
- Restart MediaServerd
- Restart CallServicesd
- Restart NSUrlsessiond
